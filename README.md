# CoronaVirusHotSpotTracker

Since the start of COVID-19, there have been over 5 Million cases around the world. The majority of the attention has been given to curing COVID patients; however, the root of the problem is the speed at which the virus spreads, inflicting an average of 25,000 more every day and as a result, has left us with over 300,000 deaths.

The virus may take days to develop symptoms and others may not exhibit symptoms and therefore, its vital to prevent a second wave by giving citizens the information to travel safely.

Our solution is to provide a platform to self-report the locations that people have traveled prior to testing positive for COVID-19. They would enter the addresses of the locations they traveled to and we then save this data and display it on an heat map. This would act as a guide for people leaving their homes where they can avoid red zones areas and take extra precautions.

To create the enviornment to run this code, you must install certain packages and APIs:

pip3 install geopy ---- pip3 install geopandas --- pip3 install flask --- pip3 install pandas --- pip3 install folium --- pip3 install numpy --- pip3 install openpyxl

After creating the environment, you must then download the files and ensure the python server is up an running. To test the code, enter 127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser. Once the HTML is connected to the python the programming should be up and running.
