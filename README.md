# CoronaVirusHotSpotTracker

Since the start of COVID-19, there have been over 5 Million cases around the world. The majority of the attention has been given to curing COVID patients; however, the root of the problem is the speed at which the virus spreads, inflicting an average of 25,000 more every day and as a result, has left us with over 300,000 deaths.

The virus may take days to develop symptoms and others may not exhibit symptoms and therefore, its vital to prevent a second wave by giving citizens the information to travel safely.

Our solution is to provide a platform to self-report the locations that people have traveled prior to testing positive for COVID-19. They would enter the addresses of the locations they traveled to and we then save this data and display it on an heat map. This would act as a guide for people leaving their homes where they can avoid red zones areas and take extra precautions.
